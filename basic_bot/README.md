# Basic Bot

This directory contains the code for a bot that performs the following steps:

1. Reads a list of markets (in the same format that will be released on the day of the contest)
2. Fetches their info from Manifold
3. Turns each market into a prompt for an LLM (optionally incorporating search results from Bing)
4. Randomly selects between buying 1 mana in YES, buying 1 mana in NO, or doing nothing
5. Executes each trade

## Example command

Run the following command to place random bets for the list of markets stored at input_data/test_markets.txt.

```
python3 run.py \
  --input_file=input_data/test_markets.txt \
  --output_file=output_data/test_results.txt \
  --bet_type=dry_run \
  --manifold_key_path=../../my-manifold-key.txt \
```

`--input_file` is a newline-separated list of Manifold market URLs. `--output_file` will be written to with the decision and reasoning for each market.

The command uses the flag `--bet_type=dry_run` to make a call to the Manifold API that will fail if making the bet is not allowed, but otherwise doesn't do anything. You can change it to `--bet_type=real` to make actual bets with your Manifold API key, or `--bet_type=none` to skip the betting step entirely.

`--manifold_key_path` should be set to a filepath pointing to a text file containing your bot's API key for Manifold.

Optionally, you can add `--bing_key_path=../../my-bing-key.txt` and `--search_type=bing` to do Bing search. You will need to make some adjustments - the current implementation of search is very minimal and uses mock queries.

Run `python3 run.py --help` to see more options.

## Setup

You will probably have to install some packages with pip before that command will work. DM me on Manifold or Discord if you're having trouble with setup.

## Creating your unique bot

Start by editing decision_maker.py to create a new DecisionMaker! This is expected to return a dictionary containing a "choice" between "BUY_YES", "BUY_NO", and "DO_NOTHING", as well as the "reasoning" for the choice (this could be helpful for debugging). You'll have to edit run.py so that it runs your new DecisionMaker rather than RandomDecisionMaker. You may also want to adjust the prompts to your liking, or add more context besides just Bing search.
