{"decision": "BUY_NO", "reasoning": "<facts>\n1. The World Health Assembly (194 member countries) agreed in June 2024 to complete negotiations on a global pandemic agreement within a year\n2. As of May 2024, intensive negotiations had concluded and outcomes were submitted for WHA consideration\n3. The timeline shows progression from initial proposal (2021) to negotiation body meetings and drafting through 2022-2024\n4. Treaty ratification typically requires domestic approval processes (e.g., Senate ratification and Presidential signature in US)\n5. 25 heads of government initially supported the call for this treaty\n6. The scope includes data-sharing, alert systems, research coordination, and medical countermeasure distribution\n7. There is only 1 month remaining in 2024 as of the forecast date\n</facts>\n\n<no>\n1. Very limited time remaining in 2024 (only December) for countries to complete domestic ratification processes (Strength: 9/10)\n2. Domestic political resistance to international health agreements post-COVID in some countries (Strength: 7/10)\n3. Complex ratification procedures in many countries require legislative approval, which can be time-consuming (Strength: 8/10)\n4. Recent history shows international treaties often face delays between agreement and ratification (Strength: 6/10)\n</no>\n\n<yes>\n1. Strong initial support from 25 heads of government shows political will exists (Strength: 6/10)\n2. Recent concrete commitments at WHA indicate momentum (Strength: 5/10)\n3. Fear of future pandemics could motivate swift action (Strength: 4/10)\n4. Some countries have streamlined ratification processes (Strength: 3/10)\n</yes>\n\n<thinking>\nThe key consideration is the extremely short timeframe remaining (one month) versus typical ratification timelines. Even with strong political will and completed negotiations, domestic ratification processes typically take months, not weeks. The timing constraint is particularly severe given:\n\n1. Many legislatures enter holiday recessions in December\n2. Ratification often requires multiple steps (committee review, floor votes, executive action)\n3. Technical implementation details often need to be worked out even after agreement on principles\n\nWhile there's clear momentum and support, the mechanical constraints of ratification processes make it highly unlikely that 10 countries could complete all necessary steps within December 2024.\n</thinking>\n\n<tentative>0.15</tentative>\n\n<thinking>\nAdditional considerations:\n\n1. Base rates: International treaties typically take 6-24 months from agreement to achieve widespread ratification\n2. Even \"fast-tracked\" treaties usually require multiple months for domestic processes\n3. The December timing is particularly problematic due to holiday schedules\n4. However, there may be some smaller countries with simplified processes who could move quickly\n5. The 10-country threshold is relatively low compared to total WHO membership (194)\n\nMy initial forecast of 0.15 appears well-calibrated given:\n- The extreme time pressure\n- Typical ratification timelines\n- Institutional constraints\n- But balanced against strong political will and the relatively low threshold of 10 countries\n\nThe mechanical constraints of ratification processes dominate other considerations given the December 2024 deadline.\n</thinking>\n\n<answer>*0.15*</answer>", "probability": 0.15, "market_url": "https://manifold.markets/Pepe/will-at-least-10-countries-ratify-a", "market_probability": 0.15466884022427616, "prompt": "\nYou are an advanced AI system which has been finetuned to provide calibrated probabilistic forecasts under uncertainty, with your performance evaluated according to the Brier score.

According to a March 2021 joint article by leaders of 23 countries as well as President of the European Council and Director-General of the World Health Organisation, the main goal of such a treaty would be to:\n\nfoster an all of government and all of society approach, strengthening national, regional and global capacities and resilience to future pandemics. This includes greatly enhancing international co-operation to improve, for example, alert systems, data-sharing, research and local, regional and global production and distribution of medical and public health counter-measures such as vaccines, medicines, diagnostics and personal protective equipment.\n\nAccording to the European Council, the following are the anticipated next steps of the planned treaty:\n\nThe intergovernmental negotiating body, tasked with drafting and negotiating this international instrument, will hold its next meeting by 1 August 2022, to discuss progress on a working draft. It will then deliver a progress report to the 76th World Health Assembly in 2023, with the aim to adopt the instrument by 2024.\n\nThe purpose of this question is to understand the potential of this treaty to be adopted.\n\nWill at least 10 countries ratify a new international treaty on pandemic prevention and preparedness before 2025?\n\nThis question will resolve as Yes if, by December 31, 2024, at least 10 countries have ratified an new international treaty on pandemic prevention and preparedness. This question concerns only new treaties, meaning treaties which have not been ratified by any nation as of June 1, 2022.\n\n**Today\u2019s date:**  \n2024-12-01\n\n**Market's closing date:**  \n2024-12-31\n\n**Comments on Manifold Markets:**\n<manifold_comments>\n- Manifold in the Wild (2022-10-22): Will at least 10 countries ratify a new international treaty on pandemic prevention and preparedness before 2025?\\n, 8k, beautiful, illustration, trending on art station, picture of the day, epic composition\n- Nevin Wetherill (2024-04-25): Ah, it sucks I don't think betting this up makes sense.
